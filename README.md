### A simple version of Football Manager
#### React Native, Node, Express, MySQL

Reqs, notes etc can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CPjBUB_xIeGby0FUNNhlLmA9KSrggnHKitWkQZ9eZ-s/edit?usp=sharing

Complexity should increase with time!

### Stuff up next:

Logic for gameweeks: Append results and display them  
Randomize how players are chosen to have scored etc  
Clean the code after minimum functionality is implemented -- we can probably reuse some components, for example the table
